### Fixed
- Daemon no longer becomes unresponsive under sustained HTTP load (#86)
- Added concurrency limit (256 max in-flight requests) to prevent tokio runtime exhaustion (#86)
- Added 30s HTTP request timeout to drop stalled connections (#86)
- Enabled SO_REUSEADDR for faster port re-binding after crash/restart (#86)
- CI workflow permissions: added `pull-requests: write` so coverage, binary size, and PR report comments can post (#90)
- WebSocket connections now cleaned up promptly on abrupt client disconnect (#87)
- Added RAII `ConnectionGuard` so per-IP connection count is always decremented on drop (#87)
- Server-initiated WebSocket ping every 15s detects dead connections (#87)
- Read timeout (60s inactivity) closes zombie connections instead of waiting 30 min (#87)
- Idle timeout now correctly persists across loop iterations (pinned sleep) (#87)
- Docs Drift check now covers workflow file changes and fails instead of only warning (#69)
- Changelog check now covers workflow and Cargo.toml changes, not just `.rs` files (#69)
- Check quality checks use `exit 1` instead of `::warning::` so they actually block PRs (#69)

### Infrastructure
- Workspace-based Rust project structure with 5 crates
- GitHub Actions workflows for security, testing, and quality assurance

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-09
