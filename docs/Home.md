## What is pi-daemon?

Pi stays as the interactive TUI coding agent you know. pi-daemon runs as a **background service** that pi connects to, adding:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Webchat UI** | Chat with agents from any browser at `http://localhost:4200` |
| **REST + WebSocket API** | Full agent management API, OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` |
| **Agent Registry** | Track all running agent instances across pi, webchat, API clients |
| **Scheduler** | Cron-based autonomous agent execution |
| **Supervisor** | Health monitoring, auto-restart, resource limits |
| **Memory Substrate** | Fast embedded SQLite layer (complements Neo4j/Graphiti) |
| **Hands** | Autonomous capability packages that work for you on schedules |
| **Wire Protocol** | Agent-to-agent P2P networking across machines |
| **Channels** | Telegram, Slack, Discord adapters |
